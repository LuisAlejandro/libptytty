libptytty - OS independent and secure pty/tty and utmp/wtmp/lastlog handling

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   -lptytty

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

I<< B<It is of paramount importance that you at least read the following
paragraph!> >>

If you are a typical terminal-like program that just wants one or more
ptys, you should call the C<ptytty::init ()> method as the very first
thing in your program:

   int main (int argc, char *argv[])
   {
      // do nothing here
      ptytty::init ();

      // initialise, parse arguments, etc.
   }

This checks wether the program runs setuid or setgid. If yes then it will
fork a helper process and drop privileges.

Some programs need finer control over if and when this helper process is
started, and if and how to drop privileges.

etc.. etc..
